## Hi there 👋, my name is Azel Sumanting

I'm an aspiring Software Developer 🖥️ with hands-on experience in building both web 💻 and mobile 📱 applications, currently I'm passionate about Front-End development.
I’ve worked using React Native, Vue.js, Firebase, and Geospatial APIs to create real-world solutions 🚀, including community safety tools 🆘 and admin dashboards 👮.
Currently looking for opportunities 🤝 where I can contribute 👏, learn 📚, and grow as a developer 👨‍💻.


- 🔭 Currently building Mayday, an emergency reporting system for the community and responders of Indang, Cavite — check it out [here].
- 🌱 Exploring Next.js, Node.js, Vite, C++, Python, and Flutter to expand my development toolkit.
